1. Describe Wordpress Ajax request

Usin Ajax in Wordpress is slightly different than using it outside of Wordpress.
We need to consider two things:
    1.1 The URL of the admin-ajax.php file, where the data to be sent for processing.
    1.2 The Ajax action hook wp-ajax_. (Custom function needs to be hooked into it and will be executed during Ajax call).
    1.3 Because we using admin-ajax.php,
     for security reasons Ajax call should be made with a Wordpress nonce
        and should be treated the same way we treat form submits:
        Capability checks, validation, samitising, user authentication and etc. 

    <php?  

        add_action('wp_ajax_my_action', 'my_action');

        function my_action(){
            //get access to database
            $global $wpdb

            $whatever = intval($_POST['whatever']);
            $whatever += 10;

            echo $whatever;

            //terminate nad return response
            wp_die();
        }

    ?>


 2. Solution for code snippet
 This can be done with PHP for example by using "include()" function
 Example shown in "form-block" folded.
 Another example is to use library like ReactJS and create form component that can be reused.
 In wordpress this can be done with custom fields (ACF plugin) and inserted as "shortcode" anywhere in page.
